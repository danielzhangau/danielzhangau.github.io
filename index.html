              Hi, I'm Bosheng Zhang, you can also call me Daniel.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently studying Computer Science degree. I love solving
              challenging problems and learning new things. I have always
              enjoyed creating things, and I love bringing creative ideas to
              life through programming. My background lie in Machine Learning. I
              pride myself on my abilities and achievements in Data Analysis,
              Statistics and Programming. My problem solving skills are often
              relied on by team-mates due to my ability to create high quality
              work in an efficient and timely manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have one year tutoring experience on Web Development. During
              that time, I got a deeper understanding of the material for my own
              self. Tutoring is a wonderful process. One way to determine how
              well you know something is by how well you can explain it to
              another. Tutoring will test that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of my studying life, I have a keen interest in all sorts
              of technology, spend a decent amount of time playing and streaming
              games, love to travel and am always on the hunt for the next hot
              restaurant in my area.

              >Image Segmentation Keras : Implementation of Segmentation on the
              ISICs data set with the Improved UNet
            </a>
          </h3>
          <p>
            The agenda of this project is to apply the improved U-Net
            architecture on the ISICs data set to predict the segmentation
            response of the lesion image in the test data set, and the overall
            minimum Dice score is 0.8.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data set is challenged by "Analysis of Skin Lesions for Melanoma
            Detection" using a data set of annotated skin lesion images from
            ISIC archives. The data set contains raw (input data) and segmented
            (response data) images of skin patches, which are used to detect
            skin lesions. The response data includes a binary mask image in PNG
            format, which indicates the position of the original skin lesion in
            each input lesion image.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the project, I learned: <br />• Solving pattern recognition
            problems, especially via deep CNN <br />• A deep learning framework,
            such as Tensorflow or PyTorch <br />• Algorithmic design
            incorporating software engineering principles, while contributing to
            a course run open source project, PatternFlow – a pattern
            recognition and image processing library for Tensorflow <br />•
            mathematical frameworks involved in understanding patterns and
            principles required for all of the above, such as group theory and
            tensor calculus

            document a significant software solution based on a design brief.
            <br />• Apply previous experience and skills in multimedia design
            and software development to deliver a complete and polished system
            that meets your client's requirements within a pre-determined
            deadline. <br />• Investigate and overcome challenges associated
            with implementing new designs and technologies. <br />• Apply sound
            project management skills (using relevant tools where necessary) to
            successfully deliver a software development project. <br />• Apply
            investigative, experimental, and prototyping methods in the software
            design and development process. <br />• Communicate effectively with
            stakeholders to gather requirements and context on briefs, and to
            manage stakeholder expectations over the course of a project.
            <br />• Develop the necessary skills to work successfully in a
            multi-disciplinary team, including the application and evaluation of
            different methods for collaborative team work. <br />• Explain and
            apply appropriate methods of user investigation, involvement and
            evaluation, using techniques tailored to your specific software
            development project. <br />• Demonstrate sound critical and

              >A* Search in LaserTank / LaserTank MDP / Reinforcement learning
              in LaserTank
            </a>
          </h3>
          <p>
            LaserTank is an open source computer puzzle game requiring logical
            thinking to solve a variety of levels, originally developed by Jim
            Kindley in 1995. In LaserTank, a player controls a tank vehicle
            which can move forwards, turn clockwise and counterclockwise, and
            shoot a laser which can be used to interact with special map
            elements. The game takes place in a 2D map divided into grid cells.
            The player must navigate from a starting position to the flag in as
            few moves as possible while avoiding "game over" conditions. The
            game is over if the player moves into a dangerous cell (i.e. water
            cells or any cell in the line of fire area of an anti-tank).
            <br />Our goal is: to turn LaserTank into a search problem, I will
            have to first define the following agent design components: <br />•
            A problem state representation (state space), <br />• A successor
            function that indicates which states can be reached from a given
            state (action space and transition function), and <br />• A cost
            function (utility function); we assume that each step has a uniform
            cost of 1.

            <br />The solver program will: (i) take a testcase filename and an
            output filename as arguments, (ii) find a solution to the testcase,
            and (iii) write the solution to an output file with the given output
            filename. It will generate a solution in the form of a
            comma-separated list of actions, taken from the set of move symbols
            defined in the supplied laser tank.py file, which are: <br />• MOVE
            FORWARD = 'f' <br />• TURN LEFT = 'l' <br />• TURN RIGHT = 'r'
            <br />• SHOOT LASER = 's'
          </p>
          <p>
            From the project, I learned: <br />• Uniform Cost Search/ A* Search
            <br />• Value Iteration (VI) / Policy Iteration (PI) <br />•
            Q-learning / SARSA

            </a>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Canadarm2 is a remote-controlled mechanical arm aboard the
            International Space Station (ISS). The robotic arm is used to
            deploy, capture and repair satellites, position astronauts, maintain
            equipment, and move cargo. <br />The system: The simplified Canadarm
            operates in a 2D workspace (rather than 3D). In particular, the 2D
            workspace is a plane, represented as [0, 1] x [0, 1] C R^2, and is
            populated by rectangular obstacles. In addition, there are grapple
            point(s) which the end effectors of the robotic arm can attach to.
            One of the end effectors must be grappled to a grapple point at any
            time. The exact dimensions and positions of each obstacle and the
            number and position of the grapple points in the environment are
            known prior to execution. <br />Given the initial and goal
            configurations of the Canadarm robotic arm, as well as a map of the
            environment, my program will find a valid path from the initial to
            the goal configurations. A valid path means that when the Canadarm
            executes the path, it will satisfy the following requirements:
            <br />1. The path consists of primitive steps. In each primitive
            step, each joint of the robot arm cannot move more than 0.001 units
            (i.e. radians or arm length). <br />2. It will not collide with any
            of the obstacles <br />3. It will not collide with itself <br />4.
            The entire Canadarm robotic arm must lie inside the workspace
            <br />5. The angle between adjacent arm segments cannot be tighter
            than 15 degrees (i.e. angles 2, 3, 4... must be between -165 deg and
            +165 deg). <br />6. The segment lengths must be within the bounds
            specified in the input file (i.e. within min and max lengths)
            <br />7. Since a primitive step is very small, it is sucient to
            satisfy requirements 2-4 at the beginning and end of each primitive
            step.

            A RUSHBAdapter is supposed to work as an adapter for one process
            only through TCP (e.g. RUSHBSvr). <br />• A RUSHBSwitch works like a
            network router, and it can be local or global.

            The final goal for this programming project is sending and receiving
            data across the global network without losses and errors. Data can
            be anything that can attached to the adapter, such as netcat, or
            RUSHBSvr, or even stdin (as in this assignment). <br />From the

            The team aims to design and develop an engaging mobile application
            with minimal cognitive demands, for university students that
            promotes efficient time management by mitigating distraction and
            aiding task management through incentivisation which, in turn,
            enables users to study in a manner that is more productive within
            the same time constraints
          </p>
          <p>
            Time management focuses on an individual’s ability to prioritise
            tasks and work effectively within a given time frame (Mindtools,
            2017). Thus, it was necessary for the team to take these two
            aforementioned factors into consideration when developing an time
            management application. With that being said, the functionality of
            the application is able to be split into four main categories: task
            management, time management, progress and incentives.
